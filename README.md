# PDF-Summarization-and-Interactive-Q-A-System
This project focuses on developing a system to summarize financial documents and facilitate interactive Q&A based on the generated summaries. Utilizing Google Generative AI and Python libraries, the system aims to streamline document analysis and provide actionable insights from large volumes of text.

## Tech Stack:

* Python: Core programming language used.
* PyPDF2: For extracting text from PDF files.
* Google Generative AI (Gemini): For generating document summaries and handling interactive Q&A.
* Google Colab: For executing and demonstrating the notebook-based solution.
  
## Methodology:

* Setup:

* API Key Configuration: Generated and configured an API key from Google AI Studio for accessing Generative AI services.
File Handling: Implemented a method to upload and process PDF files within the Google Colab environment.
PDF Preprocessing:

* Text Extraction: Utilized PyPDF2 to read and extract text from PDF documents.
Token Estimation: Estimated the token count to manage API usage and model constraints.
Model Configuration:

* Summarization: Configured Google Generative AI (Gemini) with a specific system prompt to generate concise summaries of financial documents.
Model Tuning: Used different models based on the token count and document length to optimize performance.
Execution:

* Summary Generation: Generated summaries highlighting key financial metrics, charts, company info, business models, and strategic initiatives.
Interactive Q&A: Enabled users to ask follow-up questions about the summary, facilitating a conversational analysis of the document.
Evaluation:

* Performance Metrics: Assessed the quality of summaries based on completeness, relevance, and clarity.
User Interaction: Monitored the effectiveness of the Q&A feature in addressing follow-up questions and providing relevant insights.
Results:

* Summary Accuracy: The system effectively summarized complex financial documents, providing clear and relevant insights.
* Q&A Functionality: The interactive Q&A feature enabled users to explore detailed aspects of the summaries, enhancing document analysis and decision-making.
The project delivers a comprehensive tool for financial document analysis, leveraging advanced AI capabilities to improve information extraction and interactive analysis.
